#Github User Lookup

Here's a description for the GitHub User Lookup app:

GitHub User Lookup is a web application that allows you to quickly search for GitHub users and view their profile information. With this app, you can easily retrieve details such as the user's name, company, email, gravatar image, number of followers, and number of people they follow.

The app features a user-friendly interface where you can enter a GitHub username in the input field. As you type, the app intelligently throttles API requests to ensure that only one request is made with the latest input value, even if the user types quickly. This avoids unnecessary API calls and provides a smoother user experience.

The app leverages Redux as the state management library to store and manage the user data fetched from the GitHub API. It checks the Redux store to determine if the user details are already available, preventing duplicate API requests and improving performance.

GitHub User Lookup is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It demonstrates the use of React hooks, such as useState and useEffect, to handle state and side effects. The application also showcases the integration of Redux with React using the react-redux library for efficient state management.

Experience the convenience of exploring GitHub user profiles effortlessly with GitHub User Lookup. Gain insights into developers, their affiliations, and their social connections with this intuitive and responsive web application.
